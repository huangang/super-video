#### Build once using web technologies and deploy everywhere!
An Electron Ionic application shell for creating Web Apps, Progressive Mobile Web Apps, Native Mobile Apps and Desktop Apps.

This project combines the <a href="http://electron.atom.io/">Electron Framework</a> with <a href="http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/">Ionic 2</a> and provides a starter for building out an app that can run on either the desktop (macOS, Windows and Linux), a browser or mobile devices (iOS, Android and Windows Phone).  You can use this application to build and run on one or even all of these platforms.

# Motivation
When working in small teams creating web and mobile applications, it is difficult and time consuming for new team members to pick up the different technologies for each platform. I have also been asked a few questions that motivated me to try super-video out: 
- Is there a way to run this mobile app on the desktop?
- Can we cache more in the browser for offline working?
- Can we have one Universal app that can run on the desktop, mobile, web and Office 365?

These questions made me think about the limitations of the browser for off-line editing and caching and was there a way to create a package that can be used to flesh out any app we require, whilst reducing the overhead of having to learn numerous libraries and frameworks for each platform.

And that is why I decided to try combining Electron and Ionic. Is it wise to have a universal app using a mobile framework? Probably not, but it is fun :wink:

# Quick start
The dependencies for this project are <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>, <a href="http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/getting-started/installation/">Ionic2 Framework</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cordova">Cordova</a>.

You will need:

The latest Node 6 LTS and NPM 3+ installed.

Make sure you have node installed and running, then install Ionic and Cordova globally using npm.
```
npm install -g ionic@latest cordova
```
Clone the repo, change into the super-video directory, install the npm packages and run the Electron app
```
git clone https://github.com/huangang/super-video.git
cd super-video

npm install
npm start
```
You now have Electron and Ionic running as a Desktop app.

# Running Live Reload for Electron Development
When developing a desktop app, you will want to have the app live reload as you save your changes.  
```
npm run dev
```
# Ionic CLI Commands
When developing a web app, progressive app or native mobile app, all of the Ionic CLI commands are available when you are in the src directory, as this is a standard Ionic app.  Change into the src directory and run commands from the Ionic CLI.  
```
cd src
ionic

eg:
ionic serve --lab --port 4000 -r
```

# Running on Linux
When developing on linux, you may run into a ENOSPC issue.  You will need to increase the number of file watchers to allow gulp to work.
```
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf && sudo sysctl -p
```
See: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22475849/node-js-error-enospc">Stack Overflow Post</a>

# Building on Windows
For building on Windows you will need to install the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System.  

You can download NSIS <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page">here</a>

You will need to make sure the NSIS path is added as an environment variable:
```
setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS"
```

Or using <a href="http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page">point and click.</a>

# Running on macOS
If you are generating the error: ```Error: ENFILE: file table overflow on MacOS Sierra```, you will need to adjust the number of file watchers:
```
echo kern.maxfiles=65536 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
echo kern.maxfilesperproc=65536 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=65536
sudo sysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=65536
ulimit -n 65536 
```
